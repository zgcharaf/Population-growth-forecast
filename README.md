 The Population Growth Forecast Model is designed to provide accurate predictions of population level data trends under various hypothetical scenarios. This model focuses on estimating what population growth might have looked like in the absence of specific events, like the COVID-19 pandemic. It employs advanced time series models, such as SARIMA and LSTM, to analyze historical population data and project future trends.
